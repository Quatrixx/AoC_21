# Advent of Code 2021

Solving [AoC21](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)'s puzzles after it's over, and learning python on the way. Fun!

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like." - *Eric Wastl, creator of Advent of Code*
